    "## Project Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "<!-- PELICAN_BEGIN_SUMMARY -->\n",
    "\n",
    "The motivation is gather, process and analyze Steam Store data to get insights about trends in the videogame market. As it is an online marketplace with public available data, it offers us more possibilities than analyzing console games data, where we would have to rely on an existing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to focus on two main aspects, first a general market analysis to know which genres are the most popular, pricing strategies and so on, which could be interesting for a new developer trying to make a new game or deciding a price policy. This has been studied already by other enthusiasts in internet, and also by Marketing companies helping publishers.\n",
    "\n",
    "But to offer a different analysis, we want to also focus on the developers and publishers, to see which ones are the most successfull, how they have improved / worsen between the years, which titles have cemented their success and so on. In the light of recent years we have seen many acquisitions by large publishers such as Tencent, Microsoft and Sony, so this is very interesting concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be a complete data project, with a data acquisition section (by using some APIs and web scrapping), then data cleaning and joining data from different sources, an exploratory data analysis, and finally some key conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Acquisition\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the section where I struggled initially. There were several datasets available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), reddit and similar websites, but most were outdated or did not contain all the information I wanted to explore. Also I wanted to extract it directly from an API or use web scrapping, if possible, to learn a bit more (I already had experience with Twitter which has an excellent API).\n",
    "\n",
    "[SteamSpy](https://steamspy.com/about) is a webpage which offers data about Steam games. In the past it was even able to deliver a good guess of sales, but that has become harder throughout the years. Check [VG Insights](https://vginsights.com/insights/article/how-to-estimate-steam-video-game-sales) for more information. It is also a good webpage if you want to explore market data on your own.\n",
    "The most important thing for Steamspy is that it has its own API [here](https://steamspy.com/api.php). It can provide us easily with an already filtered list of games (not other apps or DLCs), and also some metrics not available at Steam directly such as an estimate of sales and the positive or negative reviews (Steam only gives us total number reviews).\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding Steam directly, the API is available at https://partner.steamgames.com/ , however you need a developer key and some (most of the functions) are tied to your key as they are intended to be used to manage your own products at the Steam store. Thanks to [Nik Davis](http://nik-davis.github.io) I discovered there were also a few API functions via the WEB API which can be used without a key at all. See here for more details: [StorefrontAPI](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI).\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the information from Steam will be a bit more difficult, but it will give us additional metrics, such as release date, genre...\n",
    "\n",
    "We will retrieve first the list of appids and the information available at Steam Spy, then get for each appid the information from Steam and combine them in an unique dataframe. There will be no loss of information as app ids are unique. Afterwards, we will perform cleaning and finally start analyzing our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Create an app list and gather available data from SteamSpy API using 'all' request\n",
    "- Retrieve individual app data from Steam API, by iterating through app list\n",
    "- Export app list, Steam data and SteamSpy data to csv files\n",
    "\n",
    "## API references:\n",
    "\n",
    "- https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi\n",
    "- https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI\n",
    "- https://steamapi.xpaw.me/#\n",
    "- https://steamspy.com/api.php\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Credits\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important source I found while looking how to connect to the API was Nik Davis, check his blog for a different analysis on steam data (from 2019) http://nik-davis.github.io\n",
    "Download functions for the APIs are based on his notebook for \"Steam Data Download\". I had to make some changes and simplify a bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Steamspy seems to have changed its API, so I had to change the download method to instead download all the data by page (set of 1000 ids). The functions defined for Steam API itself still work as is. "

    "`Now we are ready to start downloading data and writing to file. We define our logic particular to handling the steam API - in fact if no data is returned we return just the name and appid - then begin setting some parameters. We define the files we will write our data and index to, and the columns for the csv file. The API doesn't return every column for every app, so it is best to explicitly set these.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Next we run our functions to set up the files, and make a call to process_batches to begin the process. Some additional parameters have been added for demonstration, to constrain the download to just a few rows and smaller batches. Removing these would allow the entire download process to be repeated.`\n",
    "\n",
    "I retouched many of these parameters just to check if the download could made in batches (requesting several steamapps at the same time), or even putting a faster polling rate (right now it is one second).\n",
    "\n",
    "The storefront API (http://store.steampowered.com/api/) is very much undocumented, but the key getaway is that is not possible. The official SteamWorks API lets us do other things and it is quite well documented, but we cannot get the data available at a steam webpage, which are the things interesting for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The storefront API is only accessible with these [requests](https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/User:RJackson/StorefrontAPI), and according to this [stackoverflow discussion](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46330864/steam-api-all-games):\n",
    "`There is a general API rate limit for each unique IP adress of 200 requests in five minutes which is one request every 1.5 seconds.` This matches our experience, Nik Davis put a pause between requests of just 1 second, and with this we get some but a few reconnect errors. If we put no pause at all, at the end we are limited by the 200 requests every 5 minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that for a volume of around 50k at January 2022 (the steam apps available also at steam spy, already filtered by game and some owner data...) this download will take around 21 hours. Thankfully we can resume it and do it in several batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to build a web app and we wanted to update the information daily, we could instead try pulling the full applist from steam along with the \"last updated\" and only request the full appid information for those ids. This is probably what Steam Spy does, and SteamDB instead uses a more sofisticated approach by being notified of any changes to appids via steamworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, for a one shot analysis (and not a web page where the user could explore the information), the full download approach is fine."

    "\n",
    "We could retouch them a bit, as they have a \"last updated\" key, so we also update new information and not just new ids. But that would be more suitable for a live webpage updated once a day, not for a full on analysis like we are presenting."

This might be expanded to get also the IDs with data updated.

There might be available in a separate request which is not public, or Valve just forgot to add it to the list.\n",

We could have changed the request and instead get all individual reviews, which could be an interesting machine learning analysis - we have data about if they are positive or negative, and we could do a sentiment analysis from the text using NLP. But that is not the focus of our current analysis. Also we have to note that getting the metadata was about 5h, but getting all individual reviews could take quite some time."
