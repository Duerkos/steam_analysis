    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the data gathering, we now have two separate csv files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `steamspy_appid.csv`: Full request to Steam Spy, for all available IDs (9 February 2022)\n",
    "* `steam_app_data.csv`: Full App Info from the Steam Storefront related to the previous IDs (8 February 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all the data necessary for the analysis should be at the `steam_app_data.csv`. However, in `steamspy_appid.csv` we have additional information which might be very useful:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Positive Reviews (count)\n",
    "* Negative Reviews (count)\n",
    "* Average and Medians of Concurrent Players (several columns)\n",
    "* Peak Concurrent Players (ccu column)\n",
    "* Owners estimate, by using Steam Spy algorithm (wide ranges)\n",
    "* Tags (list)\n",
    "\n",
    "That is why we should consolidate both datasets in only one dataframe for our analysis. After all, the information is all observations about unique App Games from Steam. Also, we need to carefully check if there is any missing data, or data that might not be consistent as the Steam Storefront has been around for quite some years, and there might be different information in older apps, or newer apps might have less information... It is also quite probable that some columns have duplicated values (such as developers that are the same with multiple names)...\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also good to note that we also downloaded separately the metadata from the steam reviews and stored it in `steamreviews_data.csv`. We did this after noticing discrepancies in the number of reviews between the total in Steam Store, and the numbers in Steam Spy. Here we have the exact numbers and also the rating showed at Steam, so it will be probably used as baseline for this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will probably need to do the cleaning in two big steps, first any cleaning prior to merge the two dataframes, and then the final cleaning after inspecting the joined database. This makes sense as we will have more complete data after merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us proceed with cleaning and joining, and that will allow us to do a good analysis."
